<h2>
	History of Internet
</h2>

<body>
<p>
    While watching a video about the history of the Internet, there was an interesting part, so I researched it in more detail. In this lesson, I learned about the historical figures that contributed to the Internet's founding, such as Granville, Alan Turing, and Ada Lovelace. The person who caught my attention most was Alan Turing, who is referred to as the father of computer science and computational science. I was already surprised by his achievements, but it was very interesting that the Apple company's logo is mnemonic of him. He is famous as a scholar who first attempted an intellectual experiment on how far a calculator can operate logically and laid the theoretical foundation for computer science and information engineering. However, he was reported to have committed suicide in June 1954 after eating an apple injected with cyanide while taking female hormones after being accused of obscenity under the British criminal law system, which was banned by homosexuality in 1952. The original logo of the Apple company was filled with rainbow colors in the shape of a bite-sized apple. I thought it was a logo created by Steve Jobs because he liked apples. Although Steve Jobs has not confirmed that the logo was created with inspiration from Alan Turing, I want to believe that it is related to Alan Turing. The story of these logos has the effect of making a giant apple company look more seductive.

    It was natural to go to the market to buy things and to the library  and see books and find information thirty years ago. Today, however, It can do all this at home. With just a computer turns on, you can access the information you want with a simple search, and you can buy what you want with just a few mouse clicks. This is thanks to the Internet and the World Wide Web. W3(World Wide Web) is a place where people can share information through computers connected to the Internet. If you place a document written in the language HTML in this W3, you can find the information you want by going to the linked document. These documents are referred to as web pages, and a collection of web pages is called a website. The English word we enter in the web browser address bar refers to where the document exists. And entering addresses and finding multiple documents to get information is called web surfing. As such, W3 is indispensable to internet use today. For this reason, the term cognitive W3 may be used in the same way as the Internet. The man who came up with the concept of this W3 was British computer engineer Tim Berners Lee.
